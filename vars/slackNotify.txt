<strong>slackNotify(String buildStatus = 'STARTED', String changeString = null, Boolean blueOcean = true)</strong>

<p>
    Sends notifications via Slack and email.

    Defaults to sending a "Started" notification if no status is supplied.

    If you don't supply a change set string, the plugin will look for a GIT_CHANGE_LOG environment variable, which can be supplied in your environment step via gitChangeLog(). This is done by default and only needs to be overriden if you want a custom change string.

    blueOcean controls whether the blueOcean URL or the default Jenkins URL will be supplied.
